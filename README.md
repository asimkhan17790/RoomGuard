# RoomGuard
A security App for your room. Just switch on and place your web cam in a correct way so that your whole room is covered.

Once switched on, the app keeps a check on the room using the webcam, and watches out for any activity. If there is an itruder, the app notifies you in real time and sends you a screenshot of that frame with the intruder in it.

Future scope:

Android App which will help to see through your webcam in Real Time remotely.
